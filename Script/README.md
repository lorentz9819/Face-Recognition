SCRIPT

This script were implemented using google colaboratory. So, to use them, upload the .ipynb as a new colab notebook.

In Script - Dataset Normal, the dataset used is the canonical fer2013.csv.
Otherwise, in Script - Dataset Masked, I've modified the dataset by applying a surgical mask to all the images, in order to check for the script effectiveness, using a specific tool called MaskTheFace (https://github.com/aqeelanwar/
MaskTheFace).
